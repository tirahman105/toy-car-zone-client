            What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?

            Access tokens and refresh tokens are commonly used in authentication systems to verify the identity and permissions of a client accessing protected resources.

An access token is a credential that is issued by an authentication server upon successful authentication. It contains information about the user and their granted permissions. Access tokens are typically short-lived and have an expiration time. The client includes the access token in the headers of API requests to prove its identity and access protected resources.

A refresh token is a long-lived token that is also issued by the authentication server. It is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. The client securely stores the refresh token and uses it to make a request to the authentication server to obtain a new access token. This process is usually done behind the scenes without involving the user.

To store access tokens on the client-side, they can be stored in memory or in a browser's local storage. However, storing sensitive tokens like access tokens in local storage can make them vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. It is generally recommended to store access tokens in memory or use other secure storage mechanisms provided by the platform or framework being used.

Refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side. One common approach is to store the refresh token in an HTTP-only cookie, which provides better protection against cross-site scripting attacks. The cookie can be sent automatically by the browser in subsequent requests to the authentication server for obtaining new access tokens.

It's important to note that the specific storage mechanism for access and refresh tokens may vary depending on the authentication system and the security requirements of the application. It is recommended to follow best practices and security guidelines provided by the authentication framework or library being used.
